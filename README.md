# Discount Checker

This is a simple Python script that helps you figure out if a discount is worth applying. It checks whether the discount is 20% or more before doing anything. If it is, the script calculates the reduced price. If not, it just gives you the original price as is.

## What it does

The script asks you for:
- The original price of an item
- The discount percentage

If the discount is 20% or higher, it applies the discount and prints the final price. If the discount is less than 20%, it tells you that no discount was applied and shows the original price.

## Why it ignores small discounts

Not all discounts are helpful. This script is designed to skip small ones that donâ€™t really make a difference. It's a way to focus only on real savings.

## How to use it

1. Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Save the script as `discount_calculator.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run it like this:
